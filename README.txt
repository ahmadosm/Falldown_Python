Falldown, Version 0.2

INTRODUCTION
This is a clone of the game "Falldown" that I originally encountered on the TI-83 Plus graphing calculator. It may be a clone of another game with a different name, I have no idea. It's a simple yet addicting (at least for me) game. You control a ball that is constantly falling down, towards platforms that are coming up towards it. There are gaps in between the platforms, and the ball must be maneuvered through them. If the ball lands on a platform, it gets pushed up towards the top of the screen. If the ball reaches the top of the screen, you are "crushed" and it's game over. The platforms are created more quickly over time. Points are accumulated for staying alive. The top score is kept as a high score.

RUNNING THE GAME
To run the game, you need Python (http://python.org) and Pygame (http://pygame.org) installed and functional. 

On Linux: Open up a terminal, cd to the game's directory, and type:
python falldown.py

On Windows: Go to the game directory in explorer and double-click falldown.py. If that fails, follow the same directions as for linux.

CONTROLS 
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Escape: Game Over (gets you to high score screen, from which you can exit)

The game is pretty much complete, but I might make later versions that include some extra features (the ability to pause, spiff up the graphics a bit maybe). This is my first attempt at game creation, so if you happen to look at the mess that is the file called falldown.py, please take pity on me. :)

Have fun!
